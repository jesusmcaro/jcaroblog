    "# Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're involved in a collaborative project, you're likely familiar with dev containers. They serve as a crucial tool for ensuring consistency in development environments across team members. This means you're guaranteed to be working with the same Python version, have the necessary drivers, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my current role, we leverage dev containers in conjunction with Poetry not only to enforce a standardized development environment but also to establish a uniform Python virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will demonstrate a straightforward method for creating a dev container for a Python project. In this guide, we will be creating a development container for a package called **Fablr**. In this example we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a dev container using **devcontainer.json**.\n",
    "- Specify a Docker image to complement our dev container.\n",
    "- Set up a post dev-container creation script.\n",
    "- Illustrate how to connect a VS Code instance to our dev container, including defining VS Code extensions within it.\n",
    "- Show how integrating Poetry ensures all developers work with a consistent toolkit.\n",
    "- Highlight how dev containers can enhance development in GitHub CodeSpaces.\n",

    "**Note**: A prerequisite for this article is having Docker Desktop and VS Code Installed. You can find a link to docker desktop [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). You can find another for VS Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",

    "### What are Dev Containers?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Docker?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand dev containers, first we should become a little familiar with Docker. Docker has been around since 2013 and allows you to create containerized applications, including containerized virtual machines. You can read more about virtual machines [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-virtual-machine). Using Docker containers, you can effectively create a uniform virtual machine using an image. This virtual machine can be loaded with any OS of your choosing, with any applications, drivers, and dependencies installed.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dev containers are fantastic for working in collaborative projects, they offer consistency and standardization across development environments, ensuring a unified toolkit among team members. By seamlessly integrating dev containers with Poetry, you are not only able to leverage a standardized development environment but also establish a consistent Python virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this comprehensive guide, we outlined the process of creating a dev container for the Python project **Fablr**. From defining the `devcontainer.json` to specifying Docker images, setting up post-dev-container scripts, and integrating with VS Code extensions, each step ensures a streamlined and reproducible setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the guide emphasizes the flexibility of post-container-creation scripts, showing how a `postcreate.sh` can help automate the configuration of a virtual environment using Poetry and activate it within the VS Code workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final product showcases a seamless integration of dev containers within VS Code, facilitating a straightforward setup process, and underscores the importance of leveraging Poetry for managing virtual environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find a link to the repository here: https://github.com/jesusmcaro/Fablr. Please note that further articles will build upon this repository. So you may see a difference in some of the aforementioned files and what is currently used in the repo. "
